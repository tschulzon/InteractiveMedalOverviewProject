# InteractiveMedalOverviewProject

Project in my second semester. 
We had to create an interactive overview for bavarian olympia medals with P5 JavaScript.
We got an excel-file from a museum, which contained data like the names of the athletes, the form of sport he/she did, the medals he/she won,
the cities where they came from etc.

The students chose which data they want to present in the overview and with python we edit the file and in the end we got a new file
to work with it in javascript.
